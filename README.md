## PnET-Succession_v6.1_Test

Test suite for use with Landis-II PnET-Succession v6.1 as modified by Matthew Garcia up to October 14, 2025.

There is one single-cell test available thus far.

The test uses Landis-II with:
- PnET-Cohort Library v3 
- PnET-Succession Extension v6.1
- PnET-Biomass-Output Extension

A Dockerfile is included to build Landis-II with these specific extensions on Linux.

Additional notes and instructions for running the test are in README.txt.
